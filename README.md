**DRAMSys** is a flexible DRAM subsystem design space exploration framework based on SystemC TLM-2.0. It was developed by the [Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group](https://eit.rptu.de/en/fgs/ems/home/seite) at [RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau](https://rptu.de/en/) and by [Fraunhofer IESE](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/en.html).

- Support for **DDR3/4**, **LPDDR4**, **Wide I/O 1/2**, **GDDR5/5X/6** and **HBM1/2**
- Support for **DDR5**, **LPDDR5** and **HBM3** (please contact [Matthias Jung](mailto:matthias.jung@iese.fraunhofer.de) for more information) 
- Automatic source code generation for new JEDEC standards [3] [9] from DRAMml DSL
- Various scheduling policies
- Open, closed and adaptive page policies [8]
- All-bank, same-bank, per-bank and per-2-bank refresh
- Staggered power down [5]
- Coupling to **DRAMPower** [4] and for power simulation
- **Trace Analyzer** for visual and metric-based result analysis

## Trace Analyzer Consulting and Custom-Tailored Modifications

To provide better analysis capabilities for DRAM subsystem design space exploration than the usual performance-related outputs to the console, DRAMSys offers the Trace Analyzer. 

All requests, responses and DRAM commands can be recorded in an SQLite trace database during a simulation and visualized with the tool afterwards. An evaluation of the trace databases can be performed with the powerful Python interface of the Trace Analyzer. Different metrics are described as SQL statements and formulas in Python, which can be customized or extended without recompilation.

The Trace Analyzer's main window is shown below.

If you are interested in the Trace Analyzer, if you need support with the setup of DRAMSys in a virtual platform of your company, or if you require custom modifications of the simulator please contact [Matthias Jung](mailto:matthias.jung@iese.fraunhofer.de).

## Basic Setup

Start using DRAMSys by cloning the repository.

### Dependencies

DRAMSys requires a **C++17** compiler. The build process is based on **CMake** (minimum version **3.24**). Furthermore, the simulator is based on **SystemC**. SystemC is included with FetchContent and will be build automatically with the project. If you want to use a preinstalled SystemC version, export the environment variable `SYSTEMC_HOME` (SystemC installation directory). Also make sure that the SystemC library was built with the same C++ version.

### Building DRAMSys

To build the standalone simulator for running memory trace files or traffic generators, create a build folder in the project root directory, then run CMake and make:

```bash
$ cd DRAMSys
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

To include **DRAMPower** in your build enable the CMake option `DRAMSYS_WITH_DRAMPOWER`. If you plan to integrate DRAMSys into your own SystemC TLM-2.0 project you can build only the DRAMSys library by disabling the CMake option `DRAMSYS_BUILD_CLI`.

To build DRAMSys on Windows 10 we recommend to use the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

### Executing DRAMSys

From the build directory use the commands below to execute the DRAMSys standalone.

```bash
$ cd bin
$ ./DRAMSys
```

The default configuration file is *ddr4-example.json* located in *configs/*, the default folder for all nested configuration files is *configs/*.

To run DRAMSys with a specific configuration file:

```bash
$ ./DRAMSys ../../configs/lpddr4-example.json
```

To run DRAMSys with a specific configuration file and configuration folder:

```bash
$ ./DRAMSys ../../tests/tests_regression/DDR3/ddr3-example.json ../../tests/tests_regression/DDR3/
```

More information on the configuration can be found [here](configs/README.md).

## gem5 Coupling
There are two ways to couple DRAMSys with **gem5**:
- Use the official integration of DRAMSys in gem5. More information can be found in `ext/dramsys` of the gem5 repository.
- (Deprecated) Compile gem5 as a shared library and link it with DRAMSys, which is only supported in older versions of DRAMSys (tag v4.0).

## Acknowledgements
